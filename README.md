Hi, I’m Abhishek Anand. I’m currently doing my PhD in theoretical/computational Condensed matter physics. Broadly, I am working on model Hamiltonians in fractional Quantum Hall system. 

My github contains codes related to various computations in physics, most of which were written during my PhD. I try to maintain the most recent working version of the codes in my public repos.
